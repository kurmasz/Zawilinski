<p><code>Zawilinski</code> is a Java library designed specifically to simplify the extraction of
   data from Wiktionary entries; more generally, it simplifies the process of loading
   and filtering MediaWiki XML dumps so that the resulting document object tree is of
   manageable size (i.e., small enough so that generating and accessing the object tree
   doesn't cause a typical desktop computer to "thrash").</p>
