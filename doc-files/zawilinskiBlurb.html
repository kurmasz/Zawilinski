<p><code>Zawilinski</code> is a Java library designed specifically to
   simplify the extraction of data from Wiktionary entries; more
   generally, it simplifies the process of loading and filtering
   MediaWiki XML dumps so that the resulting document object tree is
   of manageable size (i.e., small enough so that generating and
   accessing the object tree doesn't cause a typical desktop computer
   to "thrash").</p>

<p>One main advantage of <code>Zawilinski</code> over other libraries
for analyzing MediaWiki content is that it uses tools and techniques
that would be familiar to many CS 1 and CS 2 students.  For example,
many other tools require a database, which may be intimidating for
undergraduates who have limited systems administration experience.
