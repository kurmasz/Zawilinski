# Zawilinski
Zawilinski is a Java library designed specifically to simplify the extraction of data from Wiktionary entries; more generally, it simplifies the process of loading and filtering MediaWiki XML dumps so that the resulting document object tree is of manageable size (i.e., small enough so that generating and accessing the object tree doesn't cause a typical desktop computer to "thrash").

One main advantage of Zawilinski over other libraries for analyzing MediaWiki content is that it uses tools and techniques that would be familiar to many CS 1 and CS 2 students. For example, many other tools require a database, which may be intimidating for undergraduates who have limited systems administration experience.
